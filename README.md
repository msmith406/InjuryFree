# InjuryFree
This is a GitHub Pages site made for the Georgia Tech Women's Rowing Team after a season full of injuries. The site gives a comprehensive collection of exercises for full body injury prevention. It aids in determining current flexibility, and suggests stretching exercises based on these results. Additionally, it gives example wourkouts for both the athletes at home and at a gym.
