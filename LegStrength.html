    <h5>
      Why is this important?
    </h5>
    Uh, well... strong legs are pretty essential for rowing. Being dilligent about evenly strengthening your lower
    body will allow you to drive with confidence and power. THe last thing you want is to be hesitant because you're
    hurting or afraid to get hurt.
    <br /><br />
    <h5>
      How do leg injuries happen?
    </h5>
    There are lots of ways you can injure your legs and hips.
    Hip flexors are very easy to injure if you have inproper technique in a boat or on an erg. Make sure that you aren't
    over-engaging you hip flexors as you pull yourslef up from the finish. This can lead to overuse injuries. Instead,
    make sure you're activated your core every stroke.
    Hamstrings are also very susceptible to injury. They're doing a lot of work and can get pretty tired out, especially on longer pieces.
    Make sure you're stretching and rolling out your legs with a foam roller after practices to avoid straining or pulling a hamstring.
