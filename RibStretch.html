  <h5>
    Why is this important?
  </h5>
  Well. Rib injuries really hurt. It's not fun to not be able to breathe without wincing in pain. These injuries
  disrupt daily life, disturb your sleep, and keep you out of the boat and out of the gym for a long time. I'm sure any of the
  people who suffered a rib injury last year would agree. You have the opportunity to prevent this type of injury now. So just do it.
  <br/><br/>
  <h5>
    How do rib injuries happen?
  </h5>
  <strong>1. Twisting/Improper technique</strong><br/>
  Rib strain can easily happen from not "rowing the right way". In addition to doing the exercises below, make sure you're
  not twisting your torso or leaning, especially at the finish. Sometimes you don't notice you're doing it because you're
  trying to keep the boat set, so watch video of yourself or ask the rower behind you or a coach to make sure you are finishing
  correctly.<br/><br/>
  <strong>2. Impact</strong><br/>
  Though less likely on a women's squad, rib fractures can because by the repetitive impact on the ribs every stroke at the finsh.
  So be sure you're finishing all the way to the body, but not too hard. Ensuring that your feet and oarlock are postitioned
  correctly for your height will help to ensure the oar is meeting your body at the right height.<br/><br/>
  <strong>3. Fatigue</strong><br/>
  Finally, of course there is definitely the possibility of an overuse injury. Not taking care of yourself and overtraining can
  lead to all sorts of overuse injuries, including ones related to ribs and the surrounding muscles. Train smart.
  <br/> <br/>
  The Flexibility & Strength sections below were taken from documentation from Princeton Rowing. Perform these exercises 3 times per week.

        Start by siting in a chair in an upright position working on good posture.
        The side of the arm doing the exercise should be placed on the table.
        Slide your arm forward by using the muscles near your shoulder blade.
        The shoulder blade should open which is called ‚Äúscapular protraction‚Äù.
        This should be followed by sliding your arm back, as if you would be
        squeezing your shoulder blades together, but isolating one side at a
        time. This is called "scapular retraction"ù. Repeat 2 -3 sets of 15-20
        times on each side.<br /><br />

        Start by lying down on the end of a table. Use a lighter dumbbell weight

        contract the muscles surrounding the shoulder blade in order for the
        shoulder blade to slide towards the spine. Be sure not to "hike"ù your
        shoulders during exercise. Repeat 2 x 15-20 times. For the second part

        at your side to form a "T" with palms down then squeeze your shoulder
        blades together. This exercise can also be done with thumbs pointing
        upward. The third exercise is called "Y's". Place your arms above your
        head to form a "Y" with palms facing down and squeeze shoulder
        blades together. This exercise can also be done with thumbs pointing

        In a good plank position (this can be done on knees or toes depending

        maintaining proper alignment during entire exercise. Repeat 2 x 5 - 10

        For more variety, start on one side of the box in a good plank position,
        and step right arm followed by left arm onto the box, and move towards
        the other side of the box. Work your way back to left, right and so on
        Repeat 5 - 10 times.<br /><br />

        Hold a light dumbbell weight in right
        hand and place in front of your body
        keeping your elbow straight entire time.
        Start by writing the alphabet (A-Z) in
        capital letters. Rest. For the second
        part, draw circles to the right and left 10
        times each. This is important for scapular
        stabilization (the muscles near the
        shoulder blade are working to stabilize
        with added movement). Repeat on left
        side for balance.<br /><br />
