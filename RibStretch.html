      <span>Seated in a chair, reach with opposite hand of
            “trapezius” muscle being stretched and place on
            head. The hand of the side being stretched should
            be placed underneath the chair for leverage.
            Gently pull head to side. Stretch should be felt
            through your neck and trapezius muscle. Change
            position of head (forward or back) to feel different
            muscle fibers. Hold for 20 sec. Repeat 3-5 times.

      Sleeper Stretch for Posterior RC

    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        Sidelying, rest your chin on the
        shoulder that is being stretched.
        Make sure shoulder angle and arm
        are at 90 degrees. Opposite hand
        pushes arm being stretched, down
        towards the table. Stretch should be
        felt in the back of the shoulder. This is
        more of a dynamic stretch, therefore
        only needs to be held for 2-3 sec
        when end range is achieved. Switch
        side for balance. Complete 15 times. <br /><br />

              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                Start by siting in a chair in an upright position working on good posture.
                The side of the arm doing the exercise should be placed on the table.
                Slide your arm forward by using the muscles near your shoulder blade.
                The shoulder blade should open which is called “scapular protraction”.
                This should be followed by sliding your arm back, as if you would be
                squeezing your shoulder blades together, but isolating one side at a
                time. This is called “scapular retraction”. Repeat 2 -3 sets of 15-20
                times on each side.<br /><br />

                Start by lying down on the end of a table. Use a lighter dumbbell weight
                to start and progress as needed. The first part of the exercise is working
                on “scapular retraction”. While keeping your arm and elbow straight,
                contract the muscles surrounding the shoulder blade in order for the
                shoulder blade to slide towards the spine. Be sure not to “hike” your
                shoulders during exercise. Repeat 2 x 15-20 times. For the second part
                of the exercise, try holding the “scapular retraction” while doing a row.
                Repeat 2 x 15-20 times. Switch side for balance.<br /><br />

                Start by lying face down on a table. Use a rolled up towel and place

                called “I’s”. Arms are placed at your side, and squeeze your shoulder
                blades together. The second exercise is called “T’s”. Place your arms out
                at your side to form a “T” with palms down then squeeze your shoulder
                blades together. This exercise can also be done with thumbs pointing
                upward. The third exercise is called “Y’s”. Place your arms above your
                head to form a “Y” with palms facing down and squeeze shoulder
                blades together. This exercise can also be done with thumbs pointing

                  then simultaneously punch up towards the ceiling so the shoulder
                  blades separate instead of squeezing together. At the end range of the
                  exercise, there should be space between the back of your shoulder and
                  the table. Exercise should end with shoulders touching the table again.
